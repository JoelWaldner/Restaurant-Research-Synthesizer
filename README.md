Description:
The restaurant research synthesiser is an open-source relational data base architecture designed for storing and analysing large amounts of demographic and economic data.
The focus of this project is understanding how immigration effects the service industry, but also considers many economic factors.
This works by collecting publicly available demographic statistics and saving the information by regions of interest.
Each region is broken down into smaller locations that contain entities storing information about every restaurant in the area. 


Contents:
The folder SQL_Code contains the methods for creating the tables and performing the standard operations of the code.
The folder Dump_with_synthetic_data contains a dump of each table populated with up to thousands of synthetic tuples for testing and demonstration
